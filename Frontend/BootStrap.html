    <p>Bootstrap Icons is a growing library of SVG icons that are designed by @mdo and maintained by the Bootstrap Team. 
        The beginnings of this icon set come from Bootstrap’s very own components—our forms, carousels, and more. 
        Bootstrap has very few icon needs out of the box, so we didn’t need much. However, once we got going, we couldn’t stop making more. </p>
